# Project Title
react-upload-component
# Description

The React upload component is a software module exclusively designed for the React framework that enables users to upload files from their devices to a website or application built on React. Built using React's data flow architecture, this component can be easily integrated into any React-based project.

The component comes with essential features such as a user-friendly interface that allows users to select files from their device and initiate the upload process with progress bars showing the upload status. It also allows users to cancel uploads and supports a wide range of file types and sizes. Additionally, it provides advanced features such as segmented upload, timeout support, error message listening, and server response data formatting.

One of the key benefits of the React upload component is its flexibility and customization options. Developers can easily modify the component's appearance and behavior to meet the specific needs of their projects. The component can be styled to match the overall design of the website or application, and additional functionality can also be added as needed.
